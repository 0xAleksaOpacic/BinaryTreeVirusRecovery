# 🖥️ Network Virus Recovery - Binary Tree 🛡️
## Overview
A network of computers has been infected by a virus. The system administrator has a recovery software that, when run on a computer, removes the virus from that computer and all its adjacent computers. For simplicity, we assume that the network of computers is in the form of a binary tree. The goal is to find the minimum number of computers on which the system administrator needs to run the recovery software to ensure all computers in the network are virus-free.

The diagram below illustrates sample cases where the “dotted circles” represent the computers on which the recovery software should be run to minimize the recovery count.
